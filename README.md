# Evolutionary-Car-Racing-AI
Note that is just a test case.

## Description
The Evolutionary Car Racing AI project is an interactive simulation and evolutionary algorithm implementation that showcases the development of AI agents to learn and navigate through a racing circuit using genetic algorithms. The simulation involves a car navigating a circuit while being controlled by AI agents evolved using a genetic algorithm. The goal is to demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms can be applied to train agents to complete laps efficiently.

## Features
    Interactive Simulation: The project provides an interactive visualization of a car racing simulation where AI agents learn to navigate a circuit.
    Genetic Algorithm: Genetic algorithms are employed to evolve AI agents' behaviors over generations.
    Reward System: The AI agents are rewarded for completing laps, making moves, and reaching checkpoints.
    Visualization: The pygame library is utilized for visualizing the simulation, including circuit layout, car movement, and progress tracking.
